                Long writing activities are not very frequently done in class. I tend to think that my students are like me; I need the right kind of atmosphere. Writing requires time, silence and lots of inspiration. Ideally, at this time of the year, I would probably wish to be sitting next to a fireplace with the most perfect instagrammable snow falling outside my window while drinking a nice cup of coffee waiting for inspiration to strike. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt any snow where I live so I‚Äôll have to make do with a bit of rain and some reddish trees. Note: you won‚Äôt find ‚Äúinstagrammable‚Äù in the dictionary üôÇ

Inspiration, the most important word when writing and something my students claim to lack. Inspiration won‚Äôt come from your computer screen, but Internet can certainly help you a lot when struggling to find the right word. 

These are some great sites that can help you make your writing .</p>
